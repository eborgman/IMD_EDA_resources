# About the EDA Workgroup
This repository was created by the Exploratory Data Analysis Workgroup in the Inventory & Monitoring division.The focus of this group is to help anyone at IMD develop EDA skills regardless of where they are starting from. The products we share are unpolished and our ideas are in development.

The EDA workgroup will be sharing EDA projects they're working on in the Fall of 2020. While the code and the products are helpful, the thought process, rationale, and decisions will be the focus of this round of EDA workshops.  

# IMD_EDA_resources Repository
Most things related to the EDA Workgroup are in Teams (e.g. meeting agendas, call notes). However, since the code that we use and reference is often shared it GitHub it makes more sense to reference it here. Use the repository to link to existing exploratory data analysis code created by people at I&M networks. This platform was created for all IMD data managers, -ologists, technicians, and whoever is interested in EDA to ask questions, look at examples from other networks, and share ideas.

# Examples from Networks
In March through June of 2020, participants in the EDA Workgroup shared early renditions of exploratory data analysis projects they were working on. Here are some of those projects and their authors. Please add links to a GitHub repository if you have one.

1. The Mojave Desert Network created a markdown document to automate quality control for their Integrated Uplands protocol. This repository is set to private, please request access from Sarah Wright (wright13) or Nicole Hupp (hupp2it). Send them an email or teams message with your github account name to request access).

1. Understory vegetation EDA project by Jacob Gross, Lindsay Moore, Kathy Akamine (PACN) 
1. Water quality EDA project by Carmen Archambault, John Boetsch, Rebecca Lofgren, Ashley Rawhouser (NCCN), Billy Schweiger (ROMN), Krista Bartz (SWAN), Paul Gabriel (SWAN)
1. Whitebark pine EDA project by John Boetsch (NCCN) and Beth Fallon (MORA)
1. Upland vegetation EDA project by Dana Witwicki (SOPN/NCPN), Erin Borgman (ROMN), Megan Swan (SCPN), Cheryl McIntyre (CHDN/SODN) 
1. Please add your networks if you have something to share.

# Learning GitHub
The Sci/Data Vizualtion Community of Practice group recently did a how-to meeting on using GitHub. Their [example repository](https://github.com/KateMMiller/demo_repo) is helpful for beginners.You can look at [their slides](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/C6F1C26A-4B4E-4866-B05E-494541DE7032?tenantId=0693b5ba-4b18-4d7b-9341-f32f400a5494&fileType=pptx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdoimspp.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FNPS_IMD_WG_Data_Science_and_Visualization%2FShared%20Documents%2FCommunity%20of%20Practice%2FVersionControlIntro.pptx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdoimspp.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FNPS_IMD_WG_Data_Science_and_Visualization&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:278f30e624114373a65d9611498bd4fe@thread.skype&groupId=e4a2e021-b4cf-4cf6-acef-d0978b86c1a0) or, if the link is fixed, you can might be able to watch their demonstration meeting [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/873812dd-df4e-4b2b-afd2-9a62d7cfa9e5).
